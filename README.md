This is the final practice of my compilers subject.
It is an interpreter implemented in Java 6 for an invented (by my teacher) languaje.

All documentation is writen in spanish so i'll tell u somethig: 
this languaje doesn't even have variables, it's all a large expression whith local function calls.

Feel free to use it to teach monkeys programing or to tackling your own complier practice.


The work is divided in 2 parts:

  A virtual machie te execute the code (with the computer performance of a no-tip pencil).
  
  And a traslator to trasnform the invented code to the machine-code.


To use it just execute the main of the class GUI_Traductor.

Enjoy!
